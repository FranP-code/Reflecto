### 1. Project Title

Reflecto: The AI-Powered Second Brain

This title is concise and hints at the core function of the product: a mental echo (capturing thoughts) powered by AI.

### 2. Problem Statement

Knowledge workers, students, and creators constantly capture unstructured information through voice notes, quick photos, and text snippets. This information is siloed and difficult to retrieve, leading to a fragmented "second brain" where valuable insights are lost. The challenge is to seamlessly collect, process, and organize these disparate data points into a single, searchable knowledge base.

### 3. Solution

Reflecto is a web-based "second brain" deployed on Appwrite Sites that uses AI to transform unstructured data into a structured, searchable knowledge base. The application leverages a combination of **Appwrite Database**, **Storage**, and **Auth** to create a seamless user experience.

### 4. Key Features & Appwrite Services Used

- **Ingestion:** Users can upload images (e.g., photos of whiteboards, diagrams) or voice notes. The application processes these files using pre-built Hugging Face templates to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images and Speech-to-Text on audio files.
- **Processing & Organization:** The AI-processed text is then stored, along with metadata, in a searchable database.
    - **Appwrite Database:** The extracted text, along with creation date, source type (image or audio), and user-defined tags, is stored in the database.
- **Knowledge Graph (Spaces):** A powerful feature that allows users to create AI-generated connections and relationships between different pieces of captured information.
    - **Appwrite Database:** The application can analyze the text content of a "Space" and suggest relationships or topics using a smaller-scale AI model or a vector search approach. These relationships are stored in the database, allowing users to navigate their knowledge visually or semantically.
- **Search & Retrieval:** Users can search their entire knowledge base using keywords.
    - **Appwrite Database:** Leveraging Appwrite's database search capabilities for quick and efficient retrieval of all stored information.
- **Secure Authentication:** User accounts are managed to ensure that each user's data remains private and secure.
    - **Appwrite Auth:** Handles user registration, login, and secure session management.
- **File Management:** All uploaded files are stored securely.
    - **Appwrite Storage:** Manages the secure storage and retrieval of all user-uploaded images and audio files.

### 5. User Journey (MVP)

- **Landing Page:**: A simple landing page explaining the app's purpose and features.
- **User Authentication:** A new or returning user signs in via Appwrite Auth.
- **Dashboard:** The user is directed to a simple dashboard.
- **Spaces view** Spaces, working as "workspaces" to work.
- **Upload:** The user clicks "Upload," selects an image or an audio file, and uploads it via the web app.
- **Processing:** The application automatically processes the file using the AI model, extracts the text, and stores the new data in the user's **Appwrite Database**.
- **Search & View:** The user can now see the newly processed item on their dashboard and search through their entire knowledge base.
